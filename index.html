            <h2 class="subtitle">How Does Trichofol Work?</h2>
            <p>Trichofol is an amazing formula that allows you to concentrate on the real reason behind your balding. It also prevents your hair from becoming sparse and helps with hair relocation. It contains a unique combination of standard fixings that will ensure your hair grows quickly or for weeks. According to some reports, dilation of the blood vessels beneath the scalp can be improved with a daily dose of two capsules. It also relaxes the pores in the scalp, allowing for better air circulation and growth of strong, healthy hair follicles.</p>
            <p>Your hair comes from your hair follicles, and since veins and arteries surround them, they need vitamins and minerals to ensure your hair grows healthily. Apart from that, these nutrients help in your hair follicle’s maturation, growth, and maintenance. Trichofol improves the digestive tract health, thus enabling the system to absorb more nutrients for overall wellbeing. Additionally, the supplement safeguards the hair cells against free radicals and oxidative damage attacks. The supplement is rich in compounds that stabilize the hormones, thus preventing further hair loss and regenerating new hair cells.</p>
